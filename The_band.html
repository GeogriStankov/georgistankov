    	<h2>HISTORY</h2>
    	<div class="box">
    	<p class="gl">Rammstein is a deutsche music band playing industrial metal. The band is founded in 1994 in Berlin. Apart from its heavy sound, the band is distinguished by its remarkable presence of a great deal of theatre and drama in its music, reinforced by protruding electronic keyboard. The band is also known for its spectacular live performances. The structure of the songs is similar, consisting of heavy cut reefs, repeating during most of the duration of the songs against the backdrop of chaotic keyboards and chorus. Worldwide copies of their albums are over 25 million. The lyrics are aggressive, dark,  often naturalistic or grotesque. Love themes also occur, but are most often represented by their dark side. Since its foundation the members of the band remain unchanged. Since 1994 Rammstein has released six studio <a href="Albums.html">albums</a>.</p>
